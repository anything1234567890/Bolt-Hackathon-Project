# AI Next-Step: A Bolt Hackathon Project

*By: [Anamika Mishra]*

## 💡 The Idea

AI Next-Step is an intelligent feature for the Bolt app that transforms the end of a ride from a simple rating screen into a smart, new beginning. It analyzes the user's destination and the time of day to provide one useful, contextual suggestion that seamlessly connects them to Bolt's other services, like Bolt Food and Bolt Scooters.

## 🎯 The Problem it Solves

The user's journey with Bolt often ends abruptly when the ride is complete. This is a missed opportunity to keep the user engaged and to cross-promote Bolt's other valuable services. AI Next-Step solves this by anticipating the user's next need.

## 🚀 How it Works

The project is a proof-of-concept web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1.  When a ride "ends," the app simulates an arrival at a specific location (e.g., a park or a downtown area).
2.  It sends the destination and time context to the *Google Gemini AI*.
3.  The AI follows a strict set of rules to generate a relevant suggestion for either Bolt Food or Bolt Scooters.
4.  The suggestion is then displayed dynamically on the user's screen.

## ▶ How to Run the Demo

1.  Download the project files (index.html, style.css, script.js).
2.  Get a free API key from *[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)*.
3.  Open script.js and paste your API key into the geminiApiKey variable.
4.  Open index.html in a web browser.
5.  Click the "Simulate" links to see the AI in action!
